# PathFinder
Explore Optimal Paths with Vanilla JavaScript's A* Algorithm.

The A* algorithm pathfinding project is a web-based application implemented using Vanilla JavaScript that demonstrates the A* (A-star) algorithm for finding the optimal path in a grid-based environment. The application allows users to interact with a grid and visualize how the A* algorithm efficiently calculates the shortest path from the starting point to the destination while avoiding obstacles.

Certainly! Here are the features of your A* algorithm project:

**Key Features:**

1. **Interactive Grid:** The project provides an interactive grid interface where users can create obstacles and define the starting and ending points. Users can click on grid cells to toggle between obstacle and free paths.

2. **A\* Algorithm Implementation:** The core of the project is the A* algorithm, which is a heuristic search algorithm used for finding the shortest path between two points in a weighted graph. It efficiently explores the grid, considering both the cost of reaching a specific point and the estimated cost from that point to the destination.

3. **Heuristic Function:** The A* algorithm uses a heuristic function (Euclidean Distance) to estimate the cost from each grid cell to the destination. This heuristic guides the algorithm toward the most promising path, ensuring optimal efficiency.

4. **Real-time Visualization:** As the A* algorithm explores the grid, the project provides real-time visualization of the process. Users can witness the algorithm efficiently finding the shortest path by expanding nodes and exploring possible routes.

5. **Obstacle Avoidance:** Users can place obstacles on the grid to simulate real-world scenarios. The A* algorithm intelligently navigates around these obstacles to reach the destination without colliding with them.

6. **Optimal Path Identification:** The A* algorithm guarantees finding the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, making it highly efficient for pathfinding applications.

7. **Clear Instructions:** The project includes clear instructions on how to use the application, including setting the starting and ending points, adding obstacles, and initiating the pathfinding process.

8. **User-Friendly Interface:** The application is designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to interact with the grid and observe the A* algorithm in action.

9. **Code Transparency:** The project's source code is available on GitHub, providing transparency and encouraging collaboration and contributions from the open-source community.

**Usage:**

Users interested in learning about pathfinding algorithms or demonstrating the A* algorithm's efficiency can access the project on the web. They can interact with the grid, set the starting and ending points, place obstacles, and observe the A* algorithm in real-time as it finds the optimal path.

The A* algorithm pathfinding project showcases an essential pathfinding technique widely used in computer science and game development. It serves as a valuable educational tool and practical demonstration of the A* algorithm's capabilities in finding the shortest path efficiently.

**Installation and Setup Guide:**

This guide will walk you through the installation and setup process to explore the exciting world of pathfinding algorithms using the A* algorithm.we'll take it step-by-step, and soon you'll be running the project smoothly.

**Prerequisites:**

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

1. **Node.js:** The project requires Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment, to manage dependencies and run scripts. You can download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**

First, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, clone the project repository from GitHub by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Redtius/PathFinder.git
```

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd myDir
```

Next, use npm (Node Package Manager) to install all the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will download and install all the necessary packages and dependencies required to run the project.

**Step 3: Run the Development Server**

Now, you're ready to see the A* algorithm in action! To start the development server and see the project in your web browser, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will launch the development server, and you can access the project at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. The page will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source code, making development and testing smooth.

**Step 4: Build for Production**

Once you're satisfied with the project and want to create a production-ready build, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will create an optimized and minified version of the project in the `dist` directory. You can then deploy this build to a web server or hosting service for others to access.

**Congratulations!** You've successfully installed and set up the A* Algorithm Pathfinding Project. Now you can explore the world of pathfinding algorithms and witness the A* algorithm in action, finding the shortest paths with ease.

Feel free to experiment with different grid configurations, obstacles, and starting/ending points to understand the power and efficiency of the A* algorithm. If you encounter any issues or have questions, don't hesitate to ask me!
